description=Filter collection implemented with SciPy
version=0.3

about=QGIS plugin providing access to filters via the processing toolbox. \
    SciPy offers a range of highly optimised algorithms for i.e. \
    multidimensional image processing and signal processing, \
    and some can be useful to analyze raster layers.
    Includes raster filters such as:
    - binary/grey morphology (dilation, erosion, closing, opening; tophat etc.)
    - principal component analysis (PCA)
    - statistical filters (local variance, std, median, minimum, percentile etc.)
    - edge detection (sobel, prewitt, gaussian magnitude etc.) 
    - convolution with a custom kernel (both, classic and FFT versions)
    - sharpening with unsharp mask
    - noise removal with Wiener filter
    - blurring (gaussian, box filter etc.)
    - Pixel statistics (std, mean, min ... of all bands for individual pixels)
    Most filters are based on scipy.ndimage, a library to filter images (or arrays, rasters) \
    in n dimensions. These are either applied on each layer seperately in 2D, \
    or in 3D on a 3D datacube consisting of all bands. \
    In most cases, the plugin simply provides a user interface for a single SciPy function, \
    gets the raster data using GDAL, calls the SciPy function with the provided parameters \
    and loads the result back into QGIS. \
    A few filters (PCA, unsharp mask, pixel statistics etc.) use custom functions \
    that where implemented using SciPy and/or Numpy.
    For many filters, a custom footprint and/or structure or kernel can be provided, \
    adjusting the size and shape of the filter.

changelog=0.3
    - New: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Advanced option to change the dtype of the output 
    - For filters where negative values are expected in the output, use float32 as default output dtype (instead of dtype of input layer) to avoid clipping and overflow errors 
    - Convolve: normalize with sum of absolute values of kernel as default, not simply the sum
    - Unsharp mask: Avoid overflow error by calculating in float64
    - Use sizes widget in more filters
    - More load options for kernel/structure/footprint
    - New origin widget and add origin as parameter to a couple of filters
    - New set of filters for pixel statistics (std, mean, min ... for all bands of individual pixels)
    0.2
    - Catch exception if SciPy is not installed and offer to install it automatically (with pip)
    - Improved user interface with custom widgets, making it more intuitive and allowing for far better parameters (see breaking changes if you already used version 0.1 in a script or model).
    - Calculate and write band statistics (min, max, mean, std) into the metadata of the output file; enables QGIS to render correctly with min/max stretching
    - New filters:
        - unsharp mask
        - rank filter
        - uniform  filter (a.k.a. mean filter, box filter)
        - estimate local variance
        - estimate local standard deviation
        - range filter 
        - fourier gaussian filter
        - fourier ellipsoid filter
        - fourier uniform filter
        - Wiener filter
        - FFT convolve
    - Breaking changes to the parameters:
        - FOOTPRINTBOOL has been removed, if a footprint is given it is always used.
        - STRUCTURE always takes the actual structure as string, not an int (was index of combobox, the combobox has been replaced by the load button). CUSTOMSTRUCTURE has been removed.
        - Convolve: ORIGIN has been removed. (An improved version is on the todo list)
