description=Filter collection implemented with SciPy
version=0.3
author=Florian Neukirchen
email=mail@riannek.de

about=Gives access to raster filters implemented with SciPy, including morphology 
    (binary or grey dilation, erosion, closing, opening; tophat etc.),
    principal component analysis (PCA), 
    statistical filters (median, minimum, percentile etc.), edge detection
    (sobel, prewitt etc.) and convolution with a custom kernel.

changelog=0.3
    - New: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Advanced option to change the dtype of the output 
    - For filters where negative values are expected in the output, use float32 as default output dtype (instead of dtype of input layer) to avoid clipping and overflow errors 
    - Convolve: normalize with sum of absolute values of kernel as default, not simply the sum
    - Unsharp mask: Avoid overflow error by calculating in float64
    - Use sizes widget in more filters
    - More load options for kernel/structure/footprint
    - New origin widget and add origin as parameter to a couple of filters
    - New set of filters for pixel statistics (std, mean, min ... for all bands of individual pixels)
    0.2
    - Catch exception if SciPy is not installed and offer to install it automatically (with pip)
    - Improved user interface with custom widgets, making it more intuitive and allowing for far better parameters (see breaking changes if you already used version 0.1 in a script or model).
    - Calculate and write band statistics (min, max, mean, std) into the metadata of the output file; enables QGIS to render correctly with min/max stretching
    - New filters:
        - unsharp mask
        - rank filter
        - uniform  filter (a.k.a. mean filter, box filter)
        - estimate local variance
        - estimate local standard deviation
        - range filter 
        - fourier gaussian filter
        - fourier ellipsoid filter
        - fourier uniform filter
        - Wiener filter
        - FFT convolve
    - Breaking changes to the parameters:
        - FOOTPRINTBOOL has been removed, if a footprint is given it is always used.
        - STRUCTURE always takes the actual structure as string, not an int (was index of combobox, the combobox has been replaced by the load button). CUSTOMSTRUCTURE has been removed.
        - Convolve: ORIGIN has been removed. (An improved version is on the todo list)
